        <h2> Welcome! </h2>
        <p> 
            The navigation tabs have the different series that I figure that
            Roan collects.
        </p>
        <h3>Nascar Authentics 1:64</h3>
        <p>
    NASCAR Authentics 1:64 cars are the standard retail diecast cars sold at stores
    like Walmart and Target. These cars are released in numbered “waves” each year,
    with every wave containing a specific lineup of drivers, paint schemes, and
    occasionally rare chase versions. This category represents the core of the
    NASCAR collection and is the most consistent and achievable series to complete.
        </p>

        <h3>Nascar Authentics 1:64 Gold Series</h3>
        <p>
    NASCAR Authentics 1:64 Gold Series cars are a premium version of the standard
    Authentics line. They feature enhanced details such as metallic or chrome-style
    finishes, upgraded wheels, and special paint treatments. Gold Series cars are
    released in waves just like the standard line but are produced in smaller
    quantities, making them more limited and harder to find.
        </p>

        <h3>Disney Pixar Cars Singles 1:64</h3>
        <p>
    Disney Pixar Cars Singles 1:64 are individual diecast character cars based on
    the Cars movie franchise. These are sold individually at major retailers and
    are released throughout the year in case assortments. This category includes
    main characters, background racers, and new character debuts, making it ideal
    for tracking a growing and constantly evolving collection.
        </p>

        <h3>Disney Pixar Cars Themed Series</h3>
        <p>
    Disney Pixar Cars Themed Series consist of specially branded collections that
    group cars around a shared theme, such as specific locations, events, seasons,
    or visual styles. These series are clearly labeled on packaging and are released
    as complete sets, making them perfect for checklist-style collecting and easy
    progress tracking.
